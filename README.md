### MidTermExam
Francis Amenya has just created a new BMI calculator that magically calculates your BMI index as a normal Casio calculator does :wink: :grin: :satisfied:


###### The classes present are: 

+ _**MidTermExam.java**_
+ _**ExamTest.java**_

- _MidTermExam.java_ - it contains a "notMain" method which justs sits idling while watching ExamTest.java work its magic.
- _ExamTest.java_ - it contains the main method, which calls getBMI(height, weight) and calculates Francis' BMI then returns his BMI type, whether average, underweight, or overweight.


###### This is how the magic works

1. it gets your weight, in this case, Francis' (mine)

![weight](/img/weight.gif "weight")




2. it gets your height, in this case, mine again.

![height](/img/height.gif "height")




3. it gives you your bmi
